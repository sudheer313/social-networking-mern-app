## Challanges

It was very tough decision to work solo and I had to figure out my final MVP structure first and need to practice class tutorials and assignments to figure out a way to develop a MERN Stack application. Time played a crucial role developing this application.

## success

I was able to develop a MVP(minimum viable product) where users can signup, log in , Post their veiws and delete aswell.<br/>
I was able to learn GraphQL, React and also Tailwind CSS. <br/>

I feel very happy and confident after developing this application.
